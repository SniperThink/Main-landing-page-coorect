# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Removed problematic `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot`** - This was pointing to a local path that doesn't exist on Vercel's servers.

2. **Added proper engine specifications** - Ensures consistent Node.js and pnpm versions.

3. **Created `.npmrc`** - Optimizes package installation for CI/CD environments.

4. **Added `vercel.json`** - Explicitly configures build commands and timeouts.

5. **Added `.vercelignore`** - Excludes unnecessary files from deployment.

6. **Changed to `output: 'standalone'`** - Optimizes the build for serverless deployment.

## Steps to Redeploy:

1. Commit all the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Redeploy on Vercel - it should automatically trigger a new build.

## If Issues Persist:

1. **Clear Build Cache**: In Vercel dashboard, go to your project → Settings → Functions and enable "Force new build".

2. **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure Vercel is using Node.js 18+ (should be automatic with engines specification).

3. **Verify Dependencies**: All dependencies should install properly now with the `.npmrc` configuration.

## Local Testing:
The build works locally as confirmed by the successful `npm run build` command.
